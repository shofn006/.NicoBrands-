    <p>
      Nico Brands is a mastermind brand collective dedicated to identifying gaps in the everyday products, wants, and needs that shape how we live. 
      Each brand under the Nico umbrella is a passionately built project—designed to elevate the customer experience through better quality, 
      more thoughtful design, or accessible pricing.
